"""Tidy output schema — long format, one row per object. All lengths µm, volumes µm³,
intensities raw a.u. Every table carries the shared metadata block so R/Positron joins on
image_id (+ nucleus_id) and facets by genotype/sex/treatment.

Growth rule (docs/ROADMAP_modular_pipeline.md): the schema is APPEND-ONLY. A new stage appends its
columns at the end of an existing table's declared list or adds a new table in STAGE_TABLES; existing
columns are never renamed, reordered, re-typed or removed. Declared columns are written first and any
per-role extras after them (pipeline._conform_schema), so the columns of a table written by an older
commit always appear in the same relative order in the current one and the golden regression gate
(tests/test_golden.py, scripts/regression_diff.py) can tell "columns added" from "values changed". Every declared table is written on every run, empty when
its stage is off, so consumers never hit a missing file.
