"""3D nucleus segmentation.

Default = Cellpose-SAM on GPU (anisotropy from real voxel spacing). When Cellpose/torch
isn't importable (e.g. laptop smoke test), falls back to a classical, fully spacing-aware
watershed so the pipeline still runs end-to-end. The classical path is a baseline, NOT a
substitute for a fine-tuned Cellpose model on crowded pachytene nuclei (see ARCHITECTURE.md).
